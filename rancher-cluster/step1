First two steps are to test your vagarant file. Don't miss 
if you don't have ip addresses nothing will work. 

# Verify all nodes are reachable by address. 
for i in {1..5}; do  ping -c 1 172.16.16.10"$i"; done

#  Verify root login with password and execcute ip a command. Enter password 5 tikmes. 
# and do a quick eyeball check taht ip addreses are there. 
for i in {1..5}; do  ssh 172.16.16.10"$i" "ip a show"; done


# All the steps need to be done from node5 (Bootstrap node for Rancher kubernetes cluster1)
# Don't do it from each invidual machine. These steps are for easy jumping into machies.`
# generate ssh keys.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048

# Modify config file.
