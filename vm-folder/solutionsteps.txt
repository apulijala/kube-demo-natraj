  Network CIDR is 192.168.33.0/24
    
    
  1) Initialize vagarnt. 
   
  2) on each machine verify that you are able to ping every other machine.  
  for host in $(grep 192.168 /etc/hosts | awk  '{print $1}') ; do          ping -c 1 "$host"; done

  3) 192.168.33.12-16 
  
  4) Control plane 
  
  5) 192.168.33.13
  
  Kubernetes Control Plane
  1) Test if all mac addresses are unite. After running the scripts, verify the arp cache.
  arp -a | grep "192.168" | awk '{print $4}'  # Will give you mac address. 
   
  arp -a | grep "192.168" | awk '{print $4}' | wc -l # Number here. 
  arp -a | grep "192.168" | awk '{print $4}' | sort -u | wc -l # Number here. 
  
  Both of htem should return same results. 
  
  2) For jumping from one box to another. 
  we will enable ssh password login as well as key login. 
  add one user called admin in sudo group. 
  a) Enable root login. Root login is 
	# This regular expr needs to be corrected. 
   sed -i.bak -e 's@\(#\)\(PermitRootLogin\)\(.*\)@\2 yes@' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   systemctl restart sshd
   systemctl status -l sshd
   execute it on all machines.
   This just enables root login.
